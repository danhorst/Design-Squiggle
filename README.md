## Changes to the Original
 since the orginal is an Illustrator file containing a single path of variable width, which SVG does not support, there are two versions of the file:
 1. the outline shape of the original
 2. the original path with constant thickness


## 1. Outline Shape

## 2. Singe Line Path
